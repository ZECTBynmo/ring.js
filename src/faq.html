### How does Ring.js makes multiple inheritance?

Most inheritance systems in JavaScript (like John Resig's one) use prototype inheritance. They create a chain of
prototypes and the JavaScript virtual machine will recursively search that chain to find the methods to call.

Unfortunately this behavior makes it impossible to use multiple inheritance. So Ring.js uses a different system.

When a new class is created, Ring.js creates a completely new prototype by using the methods defined in its whole set of
base classes. To solve problems created by the diamond inheritances Ring.js linearize the classes graph using the [C3
algorithm as defined in the Python standard](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/).

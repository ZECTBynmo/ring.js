Ring.js is a class system in JavaScript allowing multiple inheritance.

    var Human = ring.class({
        talk: function() {
            return "hello";
        },
    });

    var Spider = ring.class({
        climb: function() {
            return "climbing";
        },
    });

    var SpiderMan = ring.class([Spider, Human], {
        talk: function() {
            return this.$super() + ", I am your friendly neighborhood";
        }
    });

    var spiderman = new SpiderMan();
    console.log(spiderman.talk());

Its advantages:

* Stop fighting against JavaScript prototype-based object oriented system. Use a class system like
  you would in Java, Python, or basically any well-known language.
* Available in the browser or in node.js. Also works with require.js.
* The inheritance system is inspired by Python3, one of the best multiple inheritance system ever.
* It's extremely fast. The performances are at least identical if not superior to John Resig's simple inheritance.
* Licensed under the MIT license.
* Damn, multiple inheritance just rocks!

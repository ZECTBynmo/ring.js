Tutorial
========

Installation in Browser
-----------------------

[Download the last release of Ring.js](/releases.html). Then extract the content of the zip file.

Ring.js has only one dependency: [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/). It is already provided in the Ring.js
release but you can use another version if you want.

To use Ring.js add theses lines to your HTML header:

    :::html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="underscore.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="ring.js"></script>

Ring.js is also compatible with [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/). Simply load the `ring.js` file and it will call
the `define()` method instead of defining a global variable.

Installation in node.js
-----------------------

Use this command to install Ring.js:

    :::sh
    npm install ring

Then inside your program:

    :::javascript
    var ring = require("ring");

Declaring Classes
-----------------

The `ring.create()` function is used to declare new classes:

    :::javascript
    var A = ring.create({
        saySomething: function() {
            return "hello world";
        },
    });
    var a = new A();
    console.log(a.saySomething()); // prints "hello world" in the JavaScript console

`ring.create()` takes a dictionary as argument. The content of that dictionary will be added to the prototype of the
class.

Constructor
-----------

    :::javascript
    var A = ring.create({
        init: function(name) {
            this.name = name;
        },
    });
    var a = new A("Nicolas");
    console.log(a.name); // prints "Nicolas"

When the dictionary of properties given to `ring.create()` contains a method named `init`, that method will be called
during the object construction with the arguments given to the class when using `new`.

Inheritance
-----------

To inherit from one or multiple classes, add a list of the classes to inherit as an argument of `ring.create()` *before*
the properties dictionary.

    :::javascript
    var A = ring.create({
        x: function() {
            return "x";
        },
    });
    var B = ring.create({
        y: function() {
            return "y";
        },
    });

    var C = ring.create([A, B], {});

    var c = new C();
    console.log(c.x()); // prints "x";
    console.log(c.y()); // prints "y";

Diamond inheritance (ie: the classes B and C both inherit from A and the class D inherits from B *and* C) is allowed by
Ring.js.

Super Method
------------

To call the super method when overriding a method, use `this.$super()`. Pass arguments to `this.$super()` to forward
arguments if necessary.

    :::javascript
    var A = ring.create({
        sayHello: function(name) {
            return "Hello " + name;
        },
    });
    var B = ring.create([A], {
        sayHello: function(name) {
            return this.$super(name) + ", nice to meet you";
        },
    });

    var b = new B();
    console.log(b.sayHello("Nicolas")); // prints "Hello Nicolas, nice to meet you"

Testing the Class of an Object
------------------------------

The standard procedure in JavaScript to test if an object is an instance of a class is to use `instanceof`. But, due to
the implementation of inheritance in Ring.js (which is necessary to have multiple inheritance), `instanceof` can not
work properly.

So you should use `ring.instance()` instead.

    :::javascript
    var A = ring.create({});
    var B = ring.create([A], {});

    console.log(ring.instance(new A(), A)); // prints "true"
    console.log(ring.instance(new B(), A)); // prints "true"

`ring.instance(obj, type)` will return `true` if `obj` is an instance of `type` or an instance of a sub-class of `type`.

`ring.instance()` can also be used with classes and objects that do not use the Ring.js class system. It will use the
`instanceof` operator in that case. It means you can safely replace all the usages of `instanceof` in any programs by
`ring.instance()` without causing problems.

Additionally, `ring.instance()` can be used to test the type of basic data types in JavaScript. To do so, use a string
as second argument instead of a class. Example:

    :::javascript
    console.log(ring.instance("", "string")); // prints "true"
    console.log(ring.instance(function() {}, "function")); // prints "true"

Creation of New Exception Types
-------------------------------

To create new exception types you are supposed to inherit from the standard `Error` class. But inheriting from that
standard class can hard. That's why Ring.js contains a feature to bring a solution to that:

    :::javascript
    var MyError = ring.create([ring.Error], {
        name: "MyError",
    });

    try {
        throw new MyError("an error occured");
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(ring.instance(e, Error)); // prints "true"
        console.log(ring.instance(e, ring.Error)); // prints "true"
        console.log(ring.instance(e, MyError)); // prints "true"
    }

The `ring.Error` class is a special class using the Ring.js class system *but* also inherits from the standard `Error`
class. You can create new exceptions classes inheriting from it and thus create complex exception hierarchies.

Please note the `name` property is a property of the standard `Error` class that can be useful for debugging. So all
exception classes should define one.
